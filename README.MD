To generate a figure, clone the repository and run the script from within the directory on your computer.  
Scripts to generate data were tested on python 3.9. Libraries used in the scripts are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and statannot.

Directory structure as follows:

./Fig_2 - Tables and scripts used to generate all panels in Figure 2  
./Fig_3 - Tables and scripts used to generate all panels in Figure 3  
./Fig_4 - Tables and scripts used to generate all panels in Figure 4  
./Fig_5 - Tables and scripts used to generate Figs. 5B-D  
./FIJI - sample images with the scripts used to generate the live cell data. FIJI script has comments at the very top for set measurements, make sure to set them so that python scripts work correctly.
