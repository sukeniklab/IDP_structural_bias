This directory contains the python program and all necessary files to generate Fig S5 in "Hidden structure in disordered proteins is adaptive to intracellular changes" (Moses et al, 2021, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.24.469609v1). Put all of these files in the same directory and run the python program, and Fig S5 will be generated. Please address any questions to David Moses (dmoses5@ucmerced.edu).
