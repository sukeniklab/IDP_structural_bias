This directory contains the python program and all necessary files to generate Figs 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E in "Hidden structure in disordered proteins is adaptive to intracellular changes" (Moses et al, 2021, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.24.469609v1). Put all of these files in the same directory and run the python program, and Figs 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E will be generated. Please address any questions to David Moses (dmoses5@ucmerced.edu).
